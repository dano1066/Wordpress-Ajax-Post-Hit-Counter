# Wordpress Ajax Post Hit Counter
This is a robust plugin for Wordpress that allows you to track real time page views without any impact on page load speed and will not be interfiered with when you are using any of the popular cache engines. 

This plugin works by using a piece of jquery that will trigger once the page has fully loaded. This means that the hit isnt counted until the user has viewed the page. This will prevent any fake views and any false hits. Once the page is loaded the hit count will be sent back to your Wordpress site where it gets added onto your posts total hits and onto your daily hit count. 

From the main dashboard, you will be able to see a graph of your daily view statistics with a nice bar graph. You will then see the most popular posts of the day based on the number of hits.
